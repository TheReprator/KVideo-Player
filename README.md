## 🙌 Inspiration & Credits

### Inspired by:
- [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js)  
  A powerful and extensible web video player — this project builds upon its robust playback capabilities by wrapping it for use in Kotlin Multiplatform WASM/JS.

### Credits:
- [Hamamas/Kotlin-Wasm-Html-Interop](https://github.com/Hamamas/Kotlin-Wasm-Html-Interop)  
  Special thanks for providing seamless HTML and DOM interop in Kotlin/WASM. This library made it possible to build this project **without relying on `dynamic`, `js()`, or unsafe interop hacks**.

- [ShreyashKore/wonderous_compose](https://github.com/ShreyashKore/wonderous_compose)  
  Helped me figure out the trick to make it run on Kotlin/JS.
