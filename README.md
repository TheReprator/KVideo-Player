## ðŸ™Œ Inspiration & Credits

### Inspired by:
- [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js)  
  A powerful and extensible web video player â€” this project builds upon its robust playback capabilities by wrapping it for use in Kotlin Multiplatform WASM.

### Credits:
- [Hamamas/Kotlin-Wasm-Html-Interop](https://github.com/Hamamas/Kotlin-Wasm-Html-Interop)  
  Special thanks for providing seamless HTML and DOM interop in Kotlin/WASM. This library made it possible to build this project **without relying on dynamic, js(), or unsafe interop hacks**.

- [https://github.com/ShreyashKore/wonderous_compose)  
  Thanks to this, i got the trick to run on JS
